  <h1>Prajakta Mali</h1>

  <p><b>Hi! I’m Prajakta Mali.</b> Welcome to my research portfolio.</p>

  <p>
    I am a Remote Sensing and GIS Analyst with a strong academic background
    in geospatial analysis, urban and environmental studies, hydrology,
    and climate applications. I hold a Master’s degree in Remote Sensing
    and GIS from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS), ISRO,
    specializing in Urban and Regional Studies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am working as a <b>Young Professional – WebGIS</b> at the
    Maharashtra Institution for Transformation (MITRA), Government of Maharashtra.
    My work focuses on urban resilience, infrastructure planning,
    and WebGIS-based decision support systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I worked as a <b>Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute
    of Science (IISc), Bengaluru</b>, where I contributed to river basin
    management, flood inundation mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR data,
    soil erosion modelling, and climate data analysis using Python.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests include urban flood modelling, hydrological
    processes, land-use change analysis, climate change impacts,
    GIS automation, and WebGIS application development.
