  <h1>Fieldwork & Data Collection Experience</h1>

  <p>
    I have conducted extensive fieldwork as part of academic research
    and professional projects, involving environmental data collection,
    hydrological sampling, geomorphological observations, and validation
    of satellite-derived outputs.
  </p>

  <h2>B.Tech Project Fieldwork – Water Quality Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    As part of my B.Tech project on water quality analysis of the
    Lower Koyana Basin, I carried out systematic field surveys focused on
    in-situ data collection and laboratory-based water quality assessment.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Collected surface water samples from <b>11 different sampling locations</b>
      along the river stretch.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conducted <b>monthly sampling over a period of three months</b>
      to capture temporal variations in water quality.
    </li>
    <li>
      Followed standard field and laboratory protocols for analysis of
      physico-chemical water quality parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated field observations and laboratory results with
      GIS-based spatial analysis for interpretation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fieldwork as Junior Research Fellow – Indian Institute of Science (IISc)</h2>
  <p>
    During my tenure as a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute
    of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, I participated in multidisciplinary
    field campaigns supporting river basin management and environmental studies.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Collected river sand and sediment samples for geomorphological
      and textural analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Collected surface and subsurface water samples for hydrological
      and water quality studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participated in field-based <b>bioassessment surveys</b> for
      river health assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Conducted <b>floodplain validation surveys</b> to support and
      verify satellite-derived flood inundation maps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Documented field observations using GPS, photographs, and
      field notes for geospatial integration.
    </li>
  </ul>
